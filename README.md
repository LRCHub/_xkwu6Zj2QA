[00:32.83] I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
[00:37.41] To search for the third key to open the gates
[00:42.47] Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
[00:47.92] As legend told my beloved sun light the dragon's eyes
[00:53.23] On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
[00:58.23] To serve right ideals and justice for all
[01:18.73] 
[01:15.78] Finally happened the sun hit their eyes
[01:20.35] The spell was creating strange games of light
[01:25.39] Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
[01:30.74] Over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
[01:36.39] In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
[01:41.37] The light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
[02:02.87] 
[01:48.38] For the king for the land for the mountains
[01:53.08] For the green valleys where dragons fly
[01:58.90] For the glory the power to win the black lord
[02:03.83] I will search for the emerald sword
[02:21.33] 
[02:59.47] Only a warrior with a clear heart
[03:05.16] Could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
[03:10.46] Yes, I am that warrior I followed my way
[03:15.91] Led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
[03:20.94] On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
[03:27.02] To serve right ideas and justice for all
[03:47.02] 
[03:33.37] For the king for the land for the mountains
[03:37.81] For the green valleys where dragons fly
[03:43.75] For the glory the power to win the black lord
[03:48.58] I will search for the emerald sword
[04:06.08] 
[03:54.63] For the king for the land for the mountains
[03:59.29] For the green valleys where dragons fly
[04:04.65] For the glory the power to win the black lord
[04:09.76] I will search for the emerald
[04:13.51] Sword
